        // Get the string as input from the user. (Or hard code the example, whichever you find better.)

        // Loop through the string one character at a time. TIP: Turn a String into an array of characters using char[] charactersInString = myString.toCharArray();

        // Which type of data structure (ArrayList, HashMap, or Array) should you use to store character counts?
        // Store character counts.

        // You'll need to "initialize" the counts for the characters in some fashion. It's probably better to do this as you go through the string, as opposed to doing so before you loop through the string. (Why?)

        // Print all the counts to the console.

        // BONUS: Ways to modify your solution.
        // Make the counts case-insensitive.
        // Exclude non-alphabetic characters.
        // Get the string as input fro the user at the command line.
        // Read the string in from a file. NOTE: This is a hard one, and we won't talk about reading from files in Java in this course, so be ready for a tough challenge if you bite this one off.
